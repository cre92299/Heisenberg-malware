# Heisenberg-malware
"Malware" that changes your background to heisenberg pixel art ( strictly windows ) and renames every file in your "C:" to a random breaking bad character for example "Gus fring"-------     ( If you accidently run this there is an option to cancel it, by saying anything but "Y" )








Doesn't work
